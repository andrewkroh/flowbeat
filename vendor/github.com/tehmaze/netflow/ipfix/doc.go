/*
Package ipfix implements a decoder for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
protocol.

About

Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) is an IETF protocol, as well
as the name of the IETF working group defining the protocol. It was created
based on the need for a common, universal standard of export for Internet
Protocol flow information from routers, probes and other devices that are used
by mediation systems, accounting/billing systems and network management systems
to facilitate services such as measurement, accounting and billing.

The IPFIX standard defines how IP flow information is to be formatted and
transferred from an exporter to a collector.
