            event.created contains the date when the event was created.
            This timestamp is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp contains
            the processed timestamp. For logs these two timestamps can be different
            as the timestamp in the log line and when the event is read for example
            by Filebeat are not identical. `@timestamp` must contain the timestamp
            extracted from the log line, event.created when the log line is read.
            The same could apply to package capturing where @timestamp contains the
            timestamp extracted from the network package and event.created when the
            event was created.
            In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.
